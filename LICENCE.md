The Customer acknowledges and agrees that, as between ControlPlane and the Customer, ControlPlane owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Service (including any improvements, modifications, and enhancements thereto), and ControlPlane shall, notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, remain the owner of the Service. All rights not expressly granted by ControlPlane herein are reserved.

ControlPlane may modify or terminate your right to use Early Access Products at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion. You understand that Early Access Products are under active development, may be inoperable or incomplete, and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than the generally available features of the Service. ControlPlane makes no representations as to the performance of such Early Access Products nor promises that any Early Access Products will ever be made generally available. All information regarding the features or performance of any Early Access Products is deemed ControlPlane Confidential Information.

3. **Subscription Term; Payment.**

3.1. The Subscription Term shall be effective as of the Effective Date and will automatically renew for additional twelve- (12-) month periods unless a party provides at least thirty (30) days’ written notice prior to the end of the then-current term that such party does not wish to renew for the upcoming term. In the case of non-renewal by the Customer, a written notice in the form as set out in Schedule 1 of this Agreement must be signed and emailed to [solutions@control-plane.io](mailto:solutions@control-plane.io) no less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Subscription Term. Upon renewal, the Customer shall pay the Fees for a new Subscription Term as confirmed in writing by ControlPlane or as set forth in a renewal Order Form, where applicable. ControlPlane reserves the right to modify the Fees or to institute new fees, as described on the Pricing Page, at any time, for any reason, and at its sole discretion. All payment inquiries should be directed to [accounts@control-plane.io](mailto:accounts@control-plane.io).

3.2. For an Offering purchased or otherwise facilitated through our sales team, pricing and other relevant terms will be set forth in writing by our sales team or, if an Order Form is in use, in such Order Form. Unless stated specifically otherwise, all payments to ControlPlane including for invoiced On-Demand Usage, are due within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice from ControlPlane to you. Late payments will bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). In addition to any of ControlPlane’s other rights or remedies, ControlPlane reserves the right to disable or suspend the Customer’s and its Administrators' and Users' access to the Service for any failure by the Customer to pay due invoices in accordance herein.

If the Customer’s purchase of the Services is through a Marketplace or through a Reseller, the Customer agrees to pay all Fees according to the standard ControlPlane Pricing Page found at each respective Marketplace or Reseller, including but not limited to all applicable charges specified for the Service (as well as incorporating any charges for use in excess of Entitlements). The ControlPlane Pricing Page is exclusive of any customs or other duty, tax, and similar levies imposed by any authority. The Customer understands it will pay the applicable Marketplace or Reseller in lieu of paying ControlPlane directly. The Customer’s acceptance of the Marketplace or Reseller pricing and terms and conditions shall bind the Customer to the obligations of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form. If the Customer purchases through a Marketplace or Reseller, the Customer will be responsible for full payment of the Fees for the Subscription Term, regardless of usage, payment or billing terms between the Customer and the Marketplace or Reseller.

3.5. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, all payments by the Customer hereunder are non-refundable and shall be made free and clear of and without reduction for all applicable withholding, sales or use, goods and services, value-added, consumption or other similar fees or taxes imposed by any government (other than taxes on the net income of ControlPlane), which shall be paid by the Customer. Accordingly, if you are required to withhold any taxes on the amounts payable to ControlPlane hereunder, you shall pay ControlPlane such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt by ControlPlane of the full amount that ControlPlane would have received but for the deduction on account of such withholding. You shall provide ControlPlane with official receipts issued by the appropriate governmental agency, or such other evidence as is reasonably requested by ControlPlane to establish that such taxes have been paid. Where applicable law requires you to self-assess or reverse-charge any taxes, you shall be responsible for complying with such law. In such a case, you undertake to provide ControlPlane with your valid Tax ID number (or VAT registration number if a UK entity) that is relevant to the Service provided under the terms of this Agreement. The amounts of any taxes required to be paid by ControlPlane will be added to ControlPlane’s invoice, and you shall promptly remit such amounts to ControlPlane, as the collection agent, upon invoice. ControlPlane reserves the right to disable your access to the Service for any failure to pay or any late payment.

Feedback expressly excludes any Customer Confidential Information and the Customer Data.

11. **Confidentiality.**

11.1. Definition. “**Confidential Information**” means any information disclosed by one party (the “**Discloser**”) to the other (the “**Recipient**”), directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, which is designated as “Confidential,” “Proprietary” or some similar designation, or learned by the Recipient under circumstances in which such information would reasonably be understood to be confidential.

11.2. Exceptions. The confidentiality obligations in this Section 11 shall not apply with respect to any information which the Recipient can demonstrate: (a) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to the Recipient or has become in the public domain through no act or omission of the Recipient; (b) was known to the Recipient, without restriction, at the time of disclosure as shown by the files of the Recipient in existence at the time of disclosure; (c) was disclosed by the Recipient with the prior written approval of the Discloser; (d) was independently developed by the Recipient without any use of the Discloser’s Confidential Information; or (e) became known to the Recipient, without restriction, from a source other than the Discloser without breach of this Agreement by the Recipient and otherwise not knowingly in violation of the Discloser’s rights.

11.3. Restrictions on Use and Disclosure. The Recipient agrees not to use the Discloser’s Confidential Information or to disclose, distribute, or disseminate the Discloser’s Confidential Information except in furtherance of the performance of its obligations or enforcement of its rights hereunder or as otherwise expressly agreed by the Discloser in writing.

11.4. The Recipient agrees to restrict access to such Confidential Information to those employees, agents, contractors, or consultants of the Recipient who need to know such Confidential Information for performing as contemplated hereunder and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those contained in this Agreement. The Recipient shall exercise the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the Discloser’s Confidential Information to others as it takes to preserve and safeguard its own information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care.

11.5. Compelled Disclosure. If the Recipient is compelled by a court or other competent authority or applicable law to disclose the Confidential Information of the Discloser, it shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, give the Discloser prompt written notice and shall provide the Discloser with reasonable cooperation at the Discloser’s expense so that the Discloser may take steps to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order. The Recipient shall not be in breach of its obligations in this Section 11 if it makes any legally compelled disclosure provided that the Recipient meets the foregoing notice and cooperation requirements.

11.6. Injunctive Relief. The Recipient acknowledges that breach of the confidentiality obligations may cause irreparable harm to the Discloser, the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that the Discloser may be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief in the event of breach of an obligation of confidentiality by the Recipient, and that the Discloser shall not be required to post a bond or show irreparable harm in order to obtain such injunctive relief.

11.7. Return of Confidential Information. As between the parties, the Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Discloser. At any time, upon the Discloser’s reasonable request, the Recipient shall promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) return to the Discloser or destroy, at the election of the Discloser, any Confidential Information of the Discloser in the Recipient’s possession. In addition, within thirty (30) days after termination of this Agreement, the Recipient shall (a) promptly return all tangible materials containing such Confidential Information to the Discloser, (b) remove all Confidential Information (and any copies thereof) from any computer systems of the Recipient and confirm in writing that all materials containing Confidential Information have been destroyed or returned to the Discloser, as applicable, by the Recipient. The Recipient shall cause its affiliates, agents, contractors, and employees to comply with the foregoing.

12. **Security.**

12.1. ControlPlane will maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security measures consistent with applicable law and current prevailing security practices and that are intended to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure of the Customer’s Data or the Service.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT THE CUSTOMER’S SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICE AND DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” CONTROLPLANE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES (IF ANY), AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICE, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, TOGETHER WITH ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, CONTROLPLANE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (IF ANY) AND AFFILIATES DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO THE CUSTOMER THAT: (A) THE CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SERVICE WILL MEET THE CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS, OR (B) THE CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING HEREIN SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT CONTROLPLANE’S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SERVICE IS NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED OR WARRANTED FOR USE IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE CONTROLS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS. CONTROLPLANE DOES NOT WARRANT ANY THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

14. **Indemnification.**

14.1. By ControlPlane. Subject to the limitation on liability set forth in Section 15, ControlPlane shall defend at its own expense any legal action brought against you to the extent that it is based on a claim or allegation that the Service (excluding any Open Source Software) infringes a U.S. patent or copyright of a third party, and ControlPlane will pay any costs and damages awarded against you in any such action, or agreed to under a settlement signed by ControlPlane, that are attributable to any such claim but shall not be responsible for any compromise made or expense incurred without ControlPlane’s consent. Such defense and payments are subject to the conditions that you (a) give ControlPlane prompt written notice of such claim, (b) tender to ControlPlane sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, and (c) reasonably cooperate with ControlPlane when requested in connection with the defense and settlement of the claim. ControlPlane will have no liability to so defend and pay for any infringement claim to the extent it (a) is based on modification of the Service other than by ControlPlane, with or without authorization; (b) results from your failure to use an updated version of the Service; or (c) is based on the combination or use of the Service with any software (including, without limitation, Open Source Software), program or device not provided by ControlPlane if such infringement would not have arisen but for such use or combination; or (d) results from use of the Service by you after the license was terminated.

14.2. Limitation on Infringement Claims. ControlPlane will have no liability to the Customer Indemnitees or any obligations under this Section 14 to the extent a claim arises out of: (a) the modification of any portion of the Service by any party other than ControlPlane or its authorized representatives; (b) the combination, operation, or use of any Service with other product(s), data, third party software, or services where the Service would not by itself be infringing; (c) the continued use of the allegedly infringing Service after being notified of the infringement claim or after being provided a modified version of the Service by ControlPlane to address any alleged infringement; or (d) the failure to use the Service in accordance with the applicable Documentation or outside the scope of the rights granted under this Agreement. Should the Service, or the operation thereof, become or in ControlPlane’s opinion be likely to become, the subject of such claim described in Section 14.1, ControlPlane may, at its option and expense, (a) procure the right for the Customer to continue using the Service, or (b) replace or modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing. If neither (a) or (b) are reasonably practicable, ControlPlane may terminate this Agreement or any applicable Order Form and refund to the Customer any pre-paid, unused Fees paid by the Customer corresponding to the unused period of the Subscription Term. THIS SECTION 14 STATES CONTROLPLANE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY, AND THE CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.

14.3. By The Customer. The Customer shall defend and hold ControlPlane and its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, and employees (“**ControlPlane Indemnitees**”) harmless against any third-party claims and actions arising from (a) an allegation that the Customer Data infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party, and (b) any use by the Customer or its Users of the Service in violation of the license restrictions in Section 4.3 of this Agreement or violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Service, and shall indemnify the ControlPlane Indemnitees against any damages, judgments, litigation costs including any reasonable attorneys’ fees.

14.4. Procedure. The party seeking indemnification will notify the indemnifying party promptly of any claim or action covered by this Section 14\. The parties agree to reasonably cooperate during such proceedings. The indemnifying party will have the right to defend any such claim and will have control over the litigation, negotiation, and settlement of any such claim, provided it will not make any settlement of a claim that results in any liability or imposes any obligation on the indemnified party without the prior written consent of such party, which will not be unreasonably withheld. The indemnified party may, at its sole expense, participate in the defense of any claim.

15. **Limitation of Liability.**

15.1. Exclusion of Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT CONTROLPLANE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES (IF ANY) AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE TO THE CUSTOMER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS) ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE CUSTOMER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.

15.2. Liability Cap. THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF CONTROLPLANE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE CUSTOMER FOR THE RELEVANT SERVICE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY APPLICABLE ORDER FORM IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

16. **Export Restrictions.**

16.1. The Customer understands that the Service is subject to United States export controls administered by the United States Department of Commerce and the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Service may not be used, transferred or otherwise exported or re-exported to countries as to which the United States, maintains an embargo (collectively, “**Embargoed Countries**”), or to or by a national or resident thereof, or any person or entity on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, Denied Persons List, or Unverified List, or the U.S. Department of State’s Nonproliferation Sanctions list (collectively, “**Designated Nationals**”).

Together with notice, we will specify the effective date of the modifications. Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on our website from time-to-time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.

19.4. Contractual Relationship. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement shall not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between the parties.

19.5. Integration and Order of Precedence. This Agreement, including any and all Order Forms, constitutes the entire agreement between the Customer and ControlPlane concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and it supersedes all prior and simultaneous proposals, agreements, understandings, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. The terms of an Order Form will prevail over the general terms herein only if such Order Form expressly references this Agreement, the intent to prevail over this Agreement, and is signed by authorized signatories of both ControlPlane and the Customer. Section headings are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation of the relevant section. No provision of any purchase order or other form employed or provided by the Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes only and shall have no legal effect.

The parties agree to use their best efforts to minimize the effects of such failures or delays. For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer understands that the Service may not be provided in countries listed in the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanction list and the Customer’s access to the Service may be restricted in such countries. Such prohibitions shall not constitute a Force Majeure.

19.7. Non-waiver. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.

19.8. Third-party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer, or is intended to confer, on any third party any benefit or the right to enforce any term of this Agreement.
